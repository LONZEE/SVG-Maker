# SVG-Maker

SVG-Maker is a Node.js application that allows users to generate SVG files based on user input. The application prompts the user for a shape, color, and text, and then generates an SVG file that includes the specified shape and text.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SVG-Maker.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd SVG-Maker`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

## Usage

Run the application using `node index.js`. You will be prompted to enter a shape, color, and text. The application will then generate an SVG file based on your input.

## Testing

Tests are run using the `npm test` command. This will run all test files in the `test` directory. The tests use the Jest testing framework and check the functionality of the shape classes and SVG generation.
